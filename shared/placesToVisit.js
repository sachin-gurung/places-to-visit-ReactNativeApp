    name: "Olympic National Park",
    description:
      "From ocean beaches to glaciered mountaintops, Olympic National Park overflows with incomparable scenery. The park covers most of the Olympic Peninsula, and roads only circle the park with a scenic drive on US 101, never cutting through the park's mountainous heart. Iconic coastal areas like Ruby and Rialto Beach define the rugged western edge of the park, only a short drive away from the over-sized trees and abundant foliage found in the Hoh Rain Forest. Other popular attractions at the park include the snowy peaks of Hurricane Ridge and the welcoming waters of Sol Duc Hot Springs. The hiking trails at Olympic National Park traverse many different landscapes, including a Hall of Mosses and the family-friendly Marymere Falls. An absolute must-do hike for all ages, the Hoh River Trail explores the rain forest and river corridor with a flat path for 13 miles before ascending to the lateral moraine of Blue Glacier on Mount Olympus.",

    name: "Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument",
    description:
      "When Mount St. Helens explosively erupted on May 18th, 1980, it reduced the peak by 1,300 feet and leveled much of the surrounding area. A cloud of ash rose 13 miles into the air. Almost 150 square miles of forest was destroyed, houses were overwhelmed by masses of water and mud, and 57 people lost their lives. The landscape of Mount St. Helens today is still rebounding from the massive event, and visitors are encouraged to learn more about the geological processes still underway at the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. Set aside for both research and recreation purposes, all the best hiking trails at Mount St. Helens provide interpretive information and a first-hand look at the destruction. It is even possible to climb Mount St. Helens, though permits are required. Visitor centers along Spirit Lake Highway (SR 504) provide further insight into the disaster, including Johnston Ridge Observatory, where it is possible to peer into the crater on a clear day.",
